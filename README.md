## Description of the project

First of all, this is my first application developed in WPF.\
I was not able to create the application with the full requests that you sent and for that __I AM VERY SORRY__.\
__BUT__ I still gave a solution covering the requests that you sent.



You can choose the level of the game which its data is taken by the `levels.json` file that I created.
I created a function that can generate a Rectangle. Inside this rectangle there are cells shaped in a rectangle form too.\
The grid size of the rectangle is taken from the Rows and Columns of each level in the .json file.
But the small rectangles(lights) are created and switched on and off in a random way.\
You can create the game by clicking on the GENERATE button.\
Here you can select the level of the game and start it.\

In the picture below we can see the game for the level 1.\

In the moves textbox, it is shown how many times has the user clicked to complete the game.\

After the game is complete, a message that 'You Won!' is shown in the screen.\

By clicking the OK button, the game starts again and we can select the level and start the game again.\

Also we can restart the game and set its settings to default by clicking the RESTART button.
